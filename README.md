# Voxel map generator in Unity

Simple project generating voxel maps using Unity engine. There are a few optimizations used here to get better performance like chunks, face hiding and dynamic generated meshes instead of drawing multiple game objects which killed my FPS when I tried it. It's a good base to create something more serious. *Maybe someday...*
